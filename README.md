# Project1
For my first project I created a mock website a minimal version of one that capture my eye
online. I used Adobe XD to create my version of how that site would be with a creative spin
to it that the original site does not have. Referencing my mock from adobe it helped me build
a website from scratch using HTML for the text, CSS to add style and color page and the text
and javascript to add event listeners & handlers. 

# Reason for project choice
The website that inspired me was nike. I enjoy buying and collecting sneakers, especially 
exclusive one's that would never find again. So why not create a site that gives poeple a 
second chance to collect them.

# How did i go about creating my website
I used Flexbox for my website, the challenge was that i didnt understand Flexbox that well.
 I had no choice but to learn it inorder to be succesful with my project. I used CSS annimations 
 and styles to add spcie to my page and i used event handlers and listeners in javascript to get 
 button features to work.

# Conclusion
Overall I managed to build my sight with a link to a second page showing the 
history of the retro 11 Space Jam jordans. I added gifs as my backgroud images for both pages and 
I added colored themes to certain text to make the pages pop. I learned so much during this journey 
on my first project and im excited to tackle more challneges.
