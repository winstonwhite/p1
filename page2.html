                        <div class="text1">The 2000 release of the Jordan Space Jam colorway was actually the first time a Jordan 11 was released as a retro. The black patent leather combined with the Varsity Royal Blue Jumpman logo and translucent outsole had Jordan collectors and MJ fans lined up for days before the release. The Space Jam Jordan 11 was the first time XIs dropped during the holidays and was the pre-cursor to the chaos that has since become the annual Jordan 11 Mid holiday release. The Air Jordan 11 Space Jam is also the reason Jordan Brand switched from Wednesday releases to Saturday releases after parents called to complain about their kids skipping school.

                                <div class="text2">While the 2000 release of the Space Jam Jordans caused Jordan brand to move their mid-week sneaker releases to Saturdays, the 2009 Space Jam 11s could easily be the craziest of all releases. By 2009, sneaker blogs were just beginning to pop off and social media had become a mainstream phenomenon--although that doesnâ€™t mean everyone knew what they were doing by then--and it had spread the buzz of the annual holiday Air Jordan 11 release far beyond the sneaker community.  The result of the iconic patent leather and ballistic nylon design in Black/Varsity Royal-White from Tinker Hatfield combined with the biggest buzz the sneaker world had ever seen, made the 2009 Air Jordan Space Jam 11 Retro one of the hardest to come by.</div>

After early speculations had the colors and shape of the silhouette slightly off, official images seem to have a majority of sneakerheads anticipating this release. If pre-release action is any indicator, the 2016 Air Jordan 11 Space Jam is one of the biggest release.</div>
